# Disease/Phenotype Data Explorer

Core annotation for diseases or phenotypes. A disease or phenotype in the Platform is understood as any disease, phenotype, biological process or measurement that might have any type of causality relationship with a human target. The EMBL-EBI Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) (slim version) is used as scaffold for the disease or phenotype entity.
