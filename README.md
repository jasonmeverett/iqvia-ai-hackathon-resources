# IQVIA AI Hackathon Resources

Some opinionated resources to help with the IQVIA AI Hackathon for contestants.

## Tool Templates

These are a set of helper tools that you can use to build your workflows, alongside the existing tools shipped with Agent Studio. Each tool has a README with a brief description of what the tool does.

## How to Install Custom Tool Templates

* Start up a session within an existing Agent Studio instance
* Once the session starts, open a terminal under "New Terminal", seen in the top menu bar of the session window
* Run this in a terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/jasonmeverett/iqvia-ai-hackathon-resources.git
```

* Enter into the directory:

```
cd iqvia-ai-hackathon-resources/
```

* Activate new tools with:

```
python activate_tools.py
```
